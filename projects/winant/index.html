        <div class="subheading mb-5">Modern cross-platform applications for network operators.</div>
        <p class="lead mb-5">Starting in the Spring of 2018, I worked as a Software Developer Intern at Monkeycube S.R.L. a software company based in Milan, Italy.
          Together with one of their developers, we developed a modern cross-platform application, based on NW Js, React Native, and Semantic UI.
          The application was a porting of a very old program written in Visual Basic; its purpose was, given a set of data and variables, to compute the optimal position
          for antenna towers for radio/television operators.
        </p>
        <h3 class="mb-2">My Roles</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          Re-implemented the whole UI using Semantic UI.<br />
          Translated some of the old features from Visual Basic to React.<br />
          Discussed and implemented additional features, like a pdf report generator.<br />
          Studied and proposed architecture and software design mplementations.<br />
          Participated to the meetings with the final customer.

      <div class="w-100">
        <h2 class="mb-5">Challenge</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-5">The main task was to create a porting of the old Visual Basic application, that was able to run only
          on a Virtual Machine equipped with Windows 98 or 2000. Additionally, the final customer asked for a cross-platform version, that could run
          not only on Windows 10, but at least on the latest version of Mac OS as well.
          <br />Finally, the GUI of the application needed to be updated to respect the latest standard and to make it more user-friendly and intuitive.
        </p>

      <div class="w-100">
        <h2 class="mb-5">Approach</h2>
        <p class="lead mb-5">When I started my internship in the company, the basic structure of the application along with some features had already been implemented in React Native.
          For this reason, I directly jumped in the development of the most important features requested by the customer maintaining the structure already in place.
          After a first month that I used to get familiar with the architecture and workflow, I started developing the first features.
          <br />
          Using a MS Excel files, we kept track of all the features that the customer was requesting us and each of us took care of some of them.
          We opted for the MS Excel solution, instead, for example, of GitHub issues, because we wanted to have something that was easy to share with the final customer and to edit for them.
          <br />
          After the first batch of features was ready and shipped to the customer (compiled into Windows binaries), I suggested to improve the GUI 
          of the product, to polish it and make it more user-friendly. So, after some researches, we opted for Semantic UI because it was easily integrable
          into React Native, as opposed to, for example, the classic bootstrap that requires JQuery and thus is not really meant to be used with React.
          <br />
          Semantic UI allowed us to build a responsive GUI, adapt for display on different devices and screen sizes, and to easily apply themes to improve the look and feel of the interface.
        </p><p>
          Finally, after around three month of studying the platform and implementing basic features, I started to take care of bigger issues, such as design and implement brand new functions.
          By the end of the internship, I implemented a pdf report generator, that collected some basic data from the GUI and from the user to then generate a pdf report 
          with only the field needed. Additionally, it exported various graphs generated by the app.

          RaspberryPi camera, then analyzed it to find the people to rescue.<br />

        <p class="lead">In the end, our car was not able to compete in the final test; even though the algorithms and the circuit were working together,
          we discovered that the processing power of the Raspberry PI alone was not enough to complete the circuit fast enough. Given the huge time and budget constrain, we were not able to
          properly test our solution (testing on the circuit had a cost as well, and a team could only reserve a certain amount of 15min slots), so we did not discover 
          this flaw until the end. Additionally, the plastic used to build the frame (that was give to us by the organizers at the beginning) was not strong enough to support 
          the components and the vibration of the motors; as a result, all the teams that could not buy the pre-made frame (so including us) were not able to assemble a car.
          <br />However, I believe that as a team we were able to work together quite efficiently even though we had just met; I learnt a lot about how to integrate 
          different components in modern circuits and many hardware techniques to adapt the voltage and the current to meet the requirements.
